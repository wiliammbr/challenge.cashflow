# challenge.cashflow
Experimental web application for controlling transactions in a store.

This application was developed using ASP.NET MVC, AngularJS, jQuery and Entity Framework.

The solution has two projects, one for the application itself and another for unit tests.
If you want to run it, just clone the repository and open the solution and Visual Studio 2013 or 2017. After that, just hit the Run button.

The database is being generated everytime you run the project, so there will always have fresh data.

Hope you enjoy it!
